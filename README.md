# Kata SOLID principles & Hexagonal Architecture

Practical exercise applying the concepts from my course on SOLID principles and hexagonal architecture for Master's
students in CTO and Tech Lead roles at HETIC.

## Context

Practical exercise applying the concepts of my course on SOLID principles and hexagonal architecture intended for master
CTO and Tech Lead students at HETIC.

With this deliberately poorly designed code, where persistence and the command system are tightly coupled, the initial
objective is to encourage students to write unit tests without modifying the source code, in order to demonstrate how
challenging it is to test an application when components are strongly interconnected. In a second phase, the goal is to
ask them to migrate the persistence to a non-relational database without altering the existing code, thus illustrating
the complexity of evolving a poorly-architected application. Finally, in a third phase, the aim is to instruct students
to refactor the code following the SOLID principles and the taught hexagonal architecture, making the code more
understandable, testable, and adaptable.

The correction for this refactoring is located on
the ["right-way"](https://github.com/adebayohountondji/kata-SOLID-principles-php/tree/right-way) branch.
